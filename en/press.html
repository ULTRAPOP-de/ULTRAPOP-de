<h1>Press</h1>
<p>The following promotional material can be used with reference to Crossfoam and a link to <a href="https://www.ultrapop.de">https://www.ultrapop.de</a> or the corresponding browser extension download pages. We highly appreciate if you send us a short note to <a href="mailto:info@ultrapop.de">info@ultrapop.de</a> when you write something about Crossfoam.</p>

<h2>Short description</h2>
<p>Crossfoam analyses and visualises your filter bubbles on social media (so far only Twitter), so you can discover the extent to which your online community is an echo chamber or a place of diverse opinions. Fine-grained analysis allows you to explore your social network, diversify it, or - if you prefer - dig deeper into your bubble. Crossfoam thus becomes a tool for electronic self-determination.</p>
<p>In order to enable this experience, Crossfoam allows you to select your own social media account (or some else’s) and download this account’s network onto your local computer. Then a network analysis is performed, which tries to identify clusters within your network (bubbles). You can then use the build-in visualisation system or download the data to use in another application.</p>
<p>Crossfoam is build privacy first. All data, analysis and visualisation is happening on your local machine, no external services are involved.</p>
